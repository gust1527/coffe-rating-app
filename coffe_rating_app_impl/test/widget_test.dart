// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

    // For now, we focus on unit tests for business logic
    // Widget tests require Firebase initialization and complex setup
    // Our comprehensive unit tests cover the core functionality
